# hauken

Program used to monitor measurement receivers supporting the SCPI protocol and GNSS receivers for sudden spectrum or GNSS related changes, 
and make a recording. Will also be able to notify mail recipients.

Created in Qt Creator. Compiles on any computer with Qt v.5.12 or higher. Not tested on v.6. For Linux: Install needed libraries (qt5serial, other? TODO,
run qmake && make. If all goes well you should be stuck with a "Hauken" binary in the end.

As for Windows, install Qt and open the Hauken.pro file in the GUI.
